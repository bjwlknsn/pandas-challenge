# pandas-challenge
An analysis of a school district's district-wide standardized test results using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Data sets included every student's math and reading scores as well as various information on the schools they attend. Data aggregated to showcase trends in school performance.

### Key Points
* Schools with a lower spending range per student (i.e., <$585 per student) have the highest overall passing percentage rate at 90.37%.
* Charter schools out perform district schools in average math scores, average reading scores, percent passing math, percent passing reading, and overall passing percentage rate.  

The final report includes each of the following:

### District Summary

* A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### School Summary

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Includes all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Uses 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Included in the table are the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* A table that groups schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large) and provides the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Type

* A table that groups schools based on school type (Charter vs. District) and provides the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
